### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

### 	:slightly_smiling_face: My name is Zahra Taheri.

#### ðŸŒ± I received my Ph.D. in `Mathematics` in 2020. Then as a postdoctoral fellow, I collaborated on a project by Professor [Hossein Hajiabolhassan](https://github.com/hhaji) at the Data Science Center of Shahid Beheshti University. I work as a research fellow at Machine Learning and Graph Mining Lab. 
    
#### :heart_on_fire: I am PASSIONATE about `programming` and `artificial intelligence` and I would like to use my skills in `math` to solve real-world problems. 

#### ðŸ”­ As a member of [Machine Learning and Graph Mining Lab](https://gmlg.github.io/), I am currently working on some applications of `graph neural networks` in molecular property prediction and drug discovery.

#### :open_book: My current research interests focus on deep learning, reinforcement learning, graph neural networks, cheminformatics, and drug design.
