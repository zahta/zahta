### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

### 	:slightly_smiling_face: My name is Zahra Taheri.

#### ðŸŒ± I am a postdoctoral researcher in data science at Shahid Beheshti University. 
    
    I obtained an MSc in applied mathematics in the coding and information theory field at the IUT, and 

    a Ph.D. in pure mathematics in the algebraic graph theory field at the UI. 
    
#### :heart_on_fire: I am PASSIONATE about `programming` and `artificial intelligence` and I would like to use my skills in math to solve real-world problems. 

#### ðŸ”­ I am currently working on some applications of `graph neural networks` in molecular property prediction and drug discovery.

#### :open_book: I am learning `reinforcement learning` and its application in molecule generation for drug design.
