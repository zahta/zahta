### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

### 	:slightly_smiling_face: My name is Zahra Taheri.

#### ðŸŒ± I am a postdoctoral researcher in `data science` at Shahid Beheshti University.    
     
        I obtained an M.Sc. in applied mathematics, and a Ph.D. in pure mathematics. 
    
#### :heart_on_fire: I am PASSIONATE about `programming` and `artificial intelligence` and I would like to use my skills in `math` to solve real-world problems. 

#### ðŸ”­ As a member of [Machine Learning and Graph Mining Lab](https://gmlg.github.io/), I am currently working on some applications of `graph neural networks` in molecular property prediction and drug discovery.

#### :open_book: I am learning `reinforcement learning` and its application in molecule generation for drug design.
