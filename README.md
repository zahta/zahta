### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

#### ðŸŒ± I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in data science at Shahid Beheshti University. 
- I obtained an MSc in applied mathematics in the coding and information theory field at the IUT, and 
- a Ph.D. in pure mathematics in the algebraic graph theory field at the UI. 

#### :heart_on_fire: I am PASSIONATE about programming and I would like to use my skills in math to solve real-world problems. 

#### ðŸ”­ I am currently working on some applications of graph neural networks and reinforcement learning in molecular property prediction and drug discovery.
